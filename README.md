### Project: Capstone

-----

Task: **Build something cool**

Deliverable: a **5-minute presentation** on February 21, 2020

-----

Note: 

> The audience is going to be UX/WDI students. So you should gear your presentation towards them (they're not going to know what RMSE is or why ROC curves are useful)...

Your project will must have a webscraping, modeling, and "flask-ing" component. It will be evaluated according to the following rubric:

| Score | Interpretation                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the outlined expectations; many major issues exist.* |
| **1** | *Project close to meeting expectations; many minor issues or a few major issues.* |
| **2** | *Project meets expectations; few (and relatively minor) mistakes.* |
| **3** | *Project demonstrates a thorough understanding of all of the considerations outlined.* |

#### Webscraping

- Build a scraper on top of BeautifulSoup, requests-html, gazpacho
- Make it a separate `.py` script
- Save the raw data so that you can come back to it
- (Honestly: I just don't want to see Kaggle .csvs. Your project should be novel!!)

#### Modeling

- Try a bunch of different approaches
- Prove that your model is better than naive one
- Use at least 1 python package that we haven't dicussed in class

#### Flask-ing

- Make your app more interesting than just a white page with input boxes
- Make sure that the live demo is actually going to work!!!
- Deploy it to Heroku/DigitalOcean (with a URL that anyone can click on â€¦ I want this on your resume)

### Tips

- Make sure you keep you stuff under 5 minutes 
- Your presentation should focus on a well-defined problem, your approach, your findings, and how your model might be used in the future
- You won't have time to present everything you've coded, so just show us the good bits!
- "What" and "Why" can be much more interesting than how, so make sure you hit:
  - What are you trying to predict?
  - Why are you doing it? Who cares?
  - What are some predictions your model has made? Are they any good?
  - What will you use it for in the future? Are there limitations or risks?
- Craft a story/narrative around your project. Don't just dump facts on the audience...
- Try to have some fun with it (I like memes and gifs!)
